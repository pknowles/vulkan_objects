# vko: Vulkan Objects

This library is a self-contained Vulkan 3D Graphics API provider and thin RAII
wrapper. It is not an engine or rendering abstraction. That said, there are some
optional utilities to make very specific but common operations easy to write.
Naturally, these are layered on top and in separate headers.

TLDR:

```cpp
#include <vko/handles.hpp>
...
vko::VulkanLibrary  library;  // Cross platform, just dlopen()
vko::GlobalCommands globalCommands(library.loader());  // bootstrap with vkGetInstanceProcAddr
vko::Instance       instance(globalCommands, VkInstanceCreateInfo{...});  // Standard CreateInfo structs
VkPhysicalDevice    physicalDevice(vko::toVector(instance.vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices, instance)[0]);
vko::Device         device(instance, physicalDevice, VkDeviceCreateInfo{...});  // Both function tables (or byo!) and VkDevice
device.vkDeviceWaitIdle(device);  // Standard vulkan API, no vulkan.hpp/vulkan_raii.hpp
```

For more example code, see [test/src/test.cpp](test/src/test.cpp). It includes ray tracingâœ¨!

The aims are:

1. Dependencies are implied by the language

   No default initialization. Delayed initialization would allow you to create
   an object before its dependencies are created or even in scope. This would
   make using the library ambiguous and error prone. For example, you can't
   create a VkCommandPool before a VkDevice and by forcing initialization a user
   will immediately be reminded to create the VkDevice first.

   If it's truly needed there is always std::optional and std::unique_ptr, which
   better show the intent of a nullable object.

2. Objects are general, have minimal dependencies and don't suck you into an
   ecosystem

   For example, it's common to pass around an everything "context" object
   containing the VkDevice, maybe an allocator or queues. This is convenient,
   but then you have to have one of these objects everywhere. In contrast,
   objects here are constructed from native vulkan objects.

   The aim is to expose the full featureset of the API near-verbatim. Objects
   should be reusable and pluggable. A big part of this is sticking to the
   single-responsibility principle.

   Shortcuts are added but special cases should be easy to override and write
   without shortcuts. This is done by layering utilities on top. Higher level
   objects can be replaced without losing much.

   A difficulty is that function tables need to be passed around. To facilitate
   using your own function tables (yes, this is possible! e.g.
   [volk](https://github.com/zeux/volk)), all objects are templates that take a
   function table as the first parameter.

3. Simple, singular implementation

   Supporting older versions and multiple ways to do things for different edge
   cases is hard. I'm only one person. I'll pick one way and do it well,
   hopefully without limiting important features.

   This includes vulkan directly from
   https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers, just for `vk.xml`,
   `vulkan_core.h` and platform-specific headers. Handles are generated, so this
   library should always support the latest vulkan.

   This library includes its own vulkan function pointer loader, like
   [volk](https://github.com/zeux/volk), but because vulkan_core.h is included,
   there is no need to support different versions. It's all one thing. One
   exception is ifdefs for platform-specific types.

4. Lifetime and ownership is well defined

   Standard RAII: out of scope cleanup, no leaks, help avoid dangling pointers,
   be safe knowing if you have a handle then the object is valid and
   initialized. Most objects are move-only and not copyable. This matches the
   API, e.g. you can't copy a VkDevice.

5. No effort plumbing

   Use existing structures to hold data. E.g. there are already many
   `*CreateInfo` structs that can be taken as an argument. No need to
   unpack/forward/pack arguments. This is the single definition rule.

   Once objects are allocated, use the Vulkan C API for certain operations. I.e.
   there is no wrapping raw `vk*()` calls as members on objects. It might look
   right to add a `drawIndexed()` (calling `vkCmdDrawIndexed`) call on a
   `CommandBuffer` object, but maybe that's never used because the raw
   `VkCommandBuffer` is passed to some higher level object and then
   `CommandBuffer` doesn't have to "know" about drawing.

   Vulkan comes with an official C++
   [vulkan.hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/blob/main/vulkan/vulkan.hpp)
   and
   [vulkan_raii.hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/blob/main/vk_raii_ProgrammingGuide.md)
   that do this. They're heavyweight in terms of line count. No really, 15MB+ of
   pure header files. They also mix in helpers, which are great, but there's no
   layering to pick just what you want to use. Admittedly, it's nice to type `.`
   and have your IDE auto-complete methods.

## Building

Cmake and C++20 is required. Currently the following dependencies are
automatically added with FetchContent:

- [Vulkan Headers](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers)
- [Vulkan Validation Layers](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers) (and dependencies! eek)
- [Slang Compiler](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang)
- [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)

Only the vulkan headers are really required. The others are optional, but
explicit optional support is on my TODO list.

## Issues

- Some `vkCreate*` calls are plural but have singular destruction. E.g.
  `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines` -> `vkDestroyPipeline`. Some `vkCreate*` calls are
  plural and have plural destruction, e.g. `vkAllocateCommandBuffers` ->
  `vkFreeCommandBuffer`. Sticking with matching the API principle, these are
  primarily modelled as a vector of handles. Singular objects are added for
  convenience too. These wrappers for these are currently hand coded until I can
  spend some time to come up with a nicer way.
- Some `vkCreate*` have no destruction. E.g. `vkCreateDisplayModeKHR`. \*shruggie\*

## Error handling

Exceptions

C++ is really lacking here. IMO it took so long for us to even get move
semantics (we still have no std::ranges::output_range) and during that time
people understandably got the wrong idea about the language and the workarounds
gave it a bad reputation. There is `std::expected` and `std::error_code`, but
they don't help with constructors.

- We must have constructors for the compiler to help us avoid delayed initialization.
- Constructors must be able to fail and the only way for that to happen is exceptions.

See:

- [Exceptionally Bad: The Misuse of Exceptions in C++ & How to Do Better - Peter Muldoon - CppCon 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy-VTqz1_58)
- [Are exceptions in C++ really slow?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13835817/are-exceptions-in-c-really-slow)

With that decision made, we need improved tooling. Particularly smooth and
intuitive experience debugging IDEs and debuggers to be able to break for
specific exception categories. I also recognise big initializer lists are ugly
AF, but they're needed. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

## Generated code

Some code is generated directly from vk.xml - see files prefixed with `gen_*`.
The loader in particularly needs this (unless you're using your own). This code
is generated to the build directory and not checked in. Generation is done with
C++ using [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml), so there is no dependency
on Python or other tools.
